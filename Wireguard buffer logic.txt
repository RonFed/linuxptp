		1.1.1) Insert to the end of queue
	1.2) If it's a WG packet
		1.2.1) Get it's SequenceId
		1.2.2) Find corresponding packet according to Type and SequnceId
		1.2.3) If first node in queue	
			1.2.3.1) Dequeue
			1.2.3.2) Continue to proccess packet
		1.2.4) If it's not the first node in queue

		1.2.5) If it's not in queue
			1.2.5.1) Add it to the queue
			
Recieved a packet:
	1) Get it's SequenceId and origin
